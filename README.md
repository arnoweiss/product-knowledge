# Catena-X Knowledge Agents (Hey Catena!) Sources

This is a [MonoRepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) linking all the modules and infrastructure codes related to the products of the Hey Catena! initiative.

The individual artifacts may be maintained in separate repositories, but are linked as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) 
so be sure to run the following command after cloning this repo:

```console
git submodule update --init
```
